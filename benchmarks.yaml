# Benchmark Test Cases for Lilith Search
# Run: python -m src.eval.benchmark --config benchmarks.yaml
# Each entry is a query plus expected results; the runner checks that the orchestrator
# returns results from the right sources and (optionally) that top results match expected items.

- query: "Emails from Sarah about budget"
  expected_sources: ["gmail"]
  expected_top_3:
    - source: "gmail"
      from: "sarah"
  precision_threshold: 0.5

- query: "What did I work on last Tuesday?"
  expected_sources: ["gmail", "browser_history"] 
  # Note: "git" might be added later if implemented
